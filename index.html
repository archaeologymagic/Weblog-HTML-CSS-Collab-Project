            <h3>----------------------------------------------------------------  An Introduction To Minecraft  ----------------------------------------------------------------</h3>


             <h2> About Minecraft </h2>
            <p> Minecraft started off a just a 3D sandbox game in 2011. Now, Minecraft has evolved into a 3D PvP/sandbox/survival/PvE game. Yea thats alot of slashes. Anyways, Minecraft has around 6 types of tools and armor. The types for the weapons include:
                <ul> 
                    <li> Wood </li>
                    <li> Stone </li>
                    <li> Iron </li>
                    <li> Gold </li>
                    <li> Diamond </li>
                    <li> Netherite </li>
                </ul>. 
                The types for the the armor include:
                <ul>
                    <li> Leather </li>
                    <li> Chainmail </li>
                    <li> Iron </li>
                    <li> Gold </li>
                    <li> Diamond </li>
                    <li> Netherite </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

           <p> Minecrafts armor and tools can be tricky for newer players, for example, while all other pickaxes can break the ore or meteral need to make them, the gold pickaxe can't, for some reason... So to help you out here is a chart for the pickaxe progression :) : </p>

                        <ul> 
                            <li> Remember to organize your inventory in a way that allows you to know which item is in each hotbar slot. </li>

                            <li> Use hotkeys to quickly switch between slots instead of using your scroll wheel. </li>

                            <li> Jumping and attacking as you fall down, will preform a crit attack which does increased damage. </li>

                        </ul>
